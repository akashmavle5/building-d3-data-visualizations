# [Building D3 Data Visualizations][published url]
## Instructor: [Tiffany France][instructor url]


D3 is a JavaScript library for creating data-driven documents, with powerful visualization and DOM manipulation components. If you want to generate beautiful charts, diagrams, or maps to represent your data, D3 is a great choice. 

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Tiffany France will show you how to use D3 and JavaScript to build two separate charts using CSV data. You'll get to follow along as she designs and implements each chart. Along the way, you'll learn how to combine visual thinking with JavaScript programming principles to create a beautiful and easy-to understand infographic for your users.
